        <h1>Why Should I Study Front-End Development?</h1>
    </div>
 <p>
            The part of a website that the user interacts with directly is termed the front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side of the application. It includes everything that users experience directly: text colors and styles, images, graphs and tables, buttons, colors, and a navigation menu. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the languages used for Front End development. Responsiveness and performance are the two main objectives of the Front End. The developer must ensure that the site is responsive i.e. it appears correctly on devices of all sizes no part of the website should behave abnormally irrespective of the size of the screen.     </p>
